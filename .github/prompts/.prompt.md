# Document Scanner App Prompt

We are seeking a skilled iOS developer to create a minimalistic app for scanning documents. The app should allow users to adjust images by cropping, rotating, and enhancing them before exporting as PDF files. A clean and high-end design is essential to ensure an excellent user experience. Please note that OCR functionality is not required for this project. If you have experience with similar projects and a strong design portfolio, we want to hear from you!
